Natural factorial => Natural x = product [1..n]

Natural main = do
  Real x in [0..7] = 0
  -- Mean that x cannot be higher than 7 and lower than 0
  Real[] x in [0..10] = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10]
  -- Mean that any element of x can be higher than 10 and lower than 0
  Natural[] twoMulTable = let x in [1..10] <- 2*x
  print factorial 5

  return 0
